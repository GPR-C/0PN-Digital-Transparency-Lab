# 0PN - Zero Public Network - Digital Fredom Technology  

*International Regulated Digital Consent Transparency Code of Conduct(IRDCTCC)*
This OPN - Digital Commons - Reopository is designed to implement the IRDCTCC -to implement digital commons infrastructur.

This organization must have a CIC Charter, and be required to implement CoE Conv. 108+ Chapter 1- Human Transparency Modalities - Art 14 1.  for community interest and public profit. 

This repository is where the open source Registrar & Notary software will be implement in a Community Interest Company. The 0PN-Codes to start services for an international public privacy policy is a  'Digital Privacy Transaprency Agreement', which people can apply to any company, to make non-compliant behaviour transparent to the Privacy Regulator. 

Anyone can be use this service to create a public Transparency Report, and start a public listing service called the Transparency Index.   Now in development in the Digital Tranaprency Lab, Canada. 

**Introduction**
The current state of the digital commons, is near tragedy, with nationalist governance frameworks and commerical - transaprency and trust frameworks, dominating the digital governance landscape.  Reflecting a historical parallel with the medieval era when gold transfers occurred between banks without the existence of notarised receipts. 

Notarised receipts revolutionised the security and efficiency of gold exchange, making it tenfold more reliable. However, today's digital governance lacks governed digital receipts (records of digital relationships, that people control) but instead is goverened with 'cookies' digital receipts you don't consent to using.  

This parallel is refelected in the use of I Agree button, linked to check-box in which people can claim they have agreed and understood terms,.  (not risks or how to access privacy rights, or see the impact of your choice)  Check-box in wich only 3% of users click through is not privacy, or consent, it is a contract, without privacy rights,. 

The extreme impact, of this is the tragedy of the commons, this effort is designed to address.   Replacing, policies no-one reads or understand, which are divorcing people and organizations from accountabilty and responsibility. This means that people can't see their choices, how they might impact the environment, find consensus, and  change pracitices to help save the environment and planet.    Enslabed to detriment of human society, 

0PN- Introduces - the I agreement replacement, and the digital trust architecture that implments the oldest trust technology known to revolutionize human-kind, called a receipt. 

OPN introduces a 2 Factor Notice for Digital transaprency, which generates a notice receipt, that people can  voluntartily use to provide services with free, prior, informed and meaningful digital consent.  Without being tracked, identified, and profiled, which makes today's privacy services pointless. 


**Historical Comparison**
In the medieval era, gold was transferred from a bank in Florence to a bank in France without notarized receipts, making the process susceptible to risks and fraud. The introduction of notarized receipts increased transparency, accountability, and trust, thereby reducing fraudulent activities, and enhancing the overall gold exchange system.

Likewise, contemporary digital governance faces a similar issue with the absence of transaction receipts. This period of analogue governance of digital spaces can be likened to a time when commercial paper had just become currency but predated the invention of cash register receipts.  At this time, the main security feature of a cash register was invented, when a bell was attached to drawer of register, notifying of its access, providing transparency in context.  Representing a major governance innovation.  This offered some level of accountability, but there was still no formal mechanism to address disputes and deceptive practices between people and services.  The introduction of transactional receipts transformed the social-economic landscape, providing an inclusive trust mechanism, fostering consensus, mitigating divisive practices, and empowering the common people against unscrupulous entities.

**Challenges in Digital Governance**
The absence of concentric interaction (notice an consent) receipts in digital governance is analogous to the "I agree" button used in online interactions. The unregulated exchange format allows entities to exploit surveillance and profit from user engagements without obtaining proper consent. Consequently, this governance framework raises concerns about privacy, consent, and ethical practices.

**The Role of Digital Credentials**
To address these challenges, the presentation of a standard digital PII Controller Credential in a standard digital notice, can be used to auto-generate a notice and consent receipt.

 The  Notice receipt  transferred in/ as a digital credential, can then be used. By the individual to make a consent token by adding this receipt and the proof of notice to consent token, returning it to the end point to access digital privacy services, like withdraw consent, without having to identify oneself to a relying party.

**Regulatory Scheme Review**

- As Quebec is implementing enforceable  Consent Law on Sept 22, this is the first chance to test this out in Canada.   
E.g. For example invalidate cookies under Quebec law and suggest an update to a regulated Transparency and Consent framework, in which DPO's have credentialsm and adtech is done with a receipt exchange,  a program running an International Regulated Digital(Transparency &) Consent Code of Conduct (IRDCCC) transparency is silent.

1.  International law and standard must be used for interoperability - a  transparency code of conduct being proposed for review between Quebec and France, must use open international regulatory instruments as a baseline to measure transparency performance against what would be 'expected to be adequate' for the digital governance of privacy expectations.   
2. This regulatory scheme  proposes that notarized and verified claims are required by services to identify people in online services. And that Digital Consent Tokens must be Anchored, with a notice receipt
3. Addressing the critical flaw in digital identity management security technology, enabling the constant breach of protected data.  
4. Approving an international Digital Consent Scheme to enable peer to peer transparency and security, this will
- 10x security and privacy
- Enable people to control their and own their own social profile.  The architecture presented is a mirrored record of processing scheme, which is synchronic as it is used to indicate if there are changes in the performance of transparency (conformance) and the integrity of the purpose (compliance) as a differential transparency signalling in the AuthC protocol.
- Evolving receipts as a trust tool for the next generation security solution, framework for engendering a digital commons.

**Empowering Individuals**
With notarized digital credentials, individuals can use this in a Self-Actioning-System protected model to become issuers of digital consent tokens, their own personal digital currency called a consent receipt.  

 Presented in the form of a consent token-based digital credentials.  This shift in the control of records of processing activities empowers individuals, enhancing their control over their personal data and digital interactions and transferring the individual trust online with digital consent.

**Mitigating Biometric surveillance**
Furthermore, mitigating the security and privacy risks with biometric surveillance through the use and implementation of notarised verified claims, replacing the username and password security profile eliminating the requirement for widespread biometric surveillance. This move the risk and liability, to reduces privacy concerns and promotes a more user-friendly and secure digital environment.
