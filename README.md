Zero Privacy Needed 
with AuthC - Notice & Consent Receipt Exchange Prototol

*International Regulated Digital Consent Code of Conduct*

The current state of technology in the digital governance landscape reflects a historical parallel with the medieval era when gold transfers occurred between banks without the existence of notarized receipts. Notarized receipts revolutionized the security and efficiency of gold exchange, making it tenfold more reliable. However, today's digital governance lacks interaction receipts (records of digital relationships, that people control) rather than e.g. cookies

**Historical Comparison**
In the medieval era, gold was transferred from a bank in Florence to a bank in France without notarized receipts, making the process susceptible to risks and fraud. The introduction of notarized receipts increased transparency, accountability, and trust, thereby reducing fraudulent activities, and enhancing the overall gold exchange system.

Likewise, contemporary digital governance faces a similar issue with the absence of transaction receipts. This period of analogue governance of digital spaces can be likened to a time when commercial paper had just become currency but predated the invention of cash register receipts.  At this time, the main security feature of a cash register was invented, when a bell was attached to drawer of register, notifying of its access, providing transparency in context.  Representing a major governance innovation.  This offered some level of accountability, but there was still no formal mechanism to address disputes and deceptive practices between people and services.  The introduction of transactional receipts transformed the social-economic landscape, providing an inclusive trust mechanism, fostering consensus, mitigating divisive practices, and empowering the common people against unscrupulous entities.

**Challenges in Digital Governance**
The absence of concentric interaction (notice an consent) receipts in digital governance is analogous to the "I agree" button used in online interactions. The unregulated exchange format allows entities to exploit surveillance and profit from user engagements without obtaining proper consent. Consequently, this governance framework raises concerns about privacy, consent, and ethical practices.


**The Role of Digital Credentials**
To address these challenges, the presentation of a standard digital PII Controller Credential in a standard digital notice, can be used to auto-generate a notice and consent receipt. 

 The  Notice receipt  transferred in/ as a digital credential, can then be used. By the invidiual to make a consent token by adding this receipt and the proof of notice to consent token, returning it to the end point to access digital privacy services, like withdraw consent, without having to identify oneself to a relying party.

**Regulatory Scheme Review**

- As Quebec is implementing enforceable  Consent Law on Sept 22, this is our chance to test this out.   
E.g. Invalidate cookies under Quebec law and replace the IABCanada Transparency and Consent framework with a real one. - as a program to create an International Digital Consent Code of Conduct,  (IDCC)

1.  International law and standard must be used for interoperability - a  transparency code of conduct being proposed for review between Quebec and France .  The outcome requiring, receipts, 
2. The scheme being proposes is that only notarized and verified claims are required by services to identify people in online services.
3. Addressing the critical flaw in digital identity management security technology, enabling the constant breach of protected data.  
4. Approving an international Digital Consent Scheme to enable peer to peer transparency and security 

10x security. The architecture presented is a mirrored record of processing scheme is a next generation security solution, that takes back control of the digital commons, with digitally twinned and notarised digital privacy. 

**Empowering Individuals**
With notarized digital credentials, individuals can use this in a Self-Actioning-System protected model to become issuers of digital consent tokens, their own personal digital currency called a consent receipt.  

 Presented in the form of a consent token-based digital credentials.  This shift in the control of records of processing activities empowers individuals, enhancing their control over their personal data and digital interactions and transferring the individual trust online with digital consent.

**Mitigating Biometric Surveillance**
Furthermore, mitigating the security and privacy risks with biometric surveillance through the use and implementation of notarized verified claims, replacing the username and password security profile eliminating the requirement for widespread biometric surveillance. This move the risk and liability, to reduces privacy concerns and promotes a more user-friendly and secure digital environment.

**Conclusion**
The adoption of notarized digital credentials as a governance framework presents a promising solution to the current challenges in digital governance. Similar to how notarized receipts transformed the gold exchange process in medieval times, this modern approach promises enhanced security, transparency, and user empowerment. By shifting towards this digital freedom technology, we can provide individuals with digital transparency to make the choice of which services to trust with access to PII and as a result trustworthy.  Fostering a sense of confidence and protection among all stakeholders involved in an inclusive Dynamic Data Ecosystem and Commons.
